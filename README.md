Shopping Basket calculating total of items in basket

This is a simple Java program that calculates the price of a basket of shopping. 
Items are presented one at a time, in a list, identified by name - 
for example "Apple" or "Banana". Multiple items are present multiple times in the list, 
so for example ["Apple", "Apple", "Banana"] is a basket with two apples and one banana. 

Items are priced as follows:

- Apples are 35p each

- Bananas are 20p each

- Melons are 50p each, but are available as ‘buy one get one free’

- Limes are 15p each, but are available in a ‘three for the price two’ offer

Application throws validation error if any item other then above 4 are present.
